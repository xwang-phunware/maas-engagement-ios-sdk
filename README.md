Engagement SDK for iOS
==================

Version 3.4.4

Overview
------------
This is Phunware's iOS SDK for Mobile Engagement, a location and notification-based system. Visit https://maas.phunware.com/ for more details and to sign up.

Requirements
------------

- PWCore 3.6.x
- iOS 9.0 or greater
- Xcode 8 or greater

Documentation
------------
Framework documentation is included in the the repository's Documents folder in both HTML and Docset formats.

- [API Reference](http://phunware.github.io/maas-engagement-ios-sdk/)
- Documentation can be found at [developer.phunware.com](https://developer.phunware.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3409591)

**Important Note:** To align with best practices, PWEngagement no longer prompts for notification nor location permissions, leaving control to the app developer. For PWEngagement to fully function as designed, both permissions must be granted.

* Notification permission: We recommend following [Apple's best practices](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/SupportingNotificationsinYourApp.html). If permission is not granted the app will not receive push notifications.

* Location permission: To function as designed, PWEngagement needs the user to “Always Allow” location in order to properly search for Geofences activity in the background. We recommend following [Apple's best practices](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/choosing_the_authorization_level_for_location_services/requesting_always_authorization?language=objc) when asking for this permission. If “Only when in use” or “Don’t allow” is chosen, the app will not monitor for regions. Therefore it will not receive geofence notifications or range on beacons.

Steps to run the sample app
------------
1. Create a new iOS Engagement application in MaaS portal.

2. Go to the directory of sample app and do a `pod install`.

3. Add the following key/value pairs to `Info.plist`:

 * `MaaSAppId`: The application ID from MaaS Portal.
 * `MaaSAccessKey`: The access key from MaaS Portal.
 * `MaaSSignatureKey`: The signature key from MaaS Portal.

4. Configure your app for push notifications.
   * Go to [developer.apple.com](http://developer.apple.com) and create a push notification certificate ([tutorial link](https://www.raywenderlich.com/123862/push-notifications-tutorial)).

   * Once it's created, download the push production certificate and add it to Keychain Access. Then, from Keychain Access, export both the certificate and key. (Right click to view the Export option) as a  .p12 and set a password.

   * Now, log on to the [MaaS Portal](https://maas.phunware.com), navigate to the app created for your application and update the following.
     * Certificate (.p12): Click the grey ellipses button to upload the Production Push Certificate you created on developer.apple.com.
     * Password: The password you setup for the push certificate.
     * Environment: Use Production environment for production apps.
