/**
 * The mobile engagement framework is a location and notification based system.
 *
 * The recommended way to start mobile engagement in your application is to place a call
 * to `+startWithmaasAppId:accessKey:signatureKey:encryptionKey:completion:` in your `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.
 *
 * This delay defaults to 1 second in order to generally give the application time to
 * fully finish launching.
 *
 * The framework needs you to forward the following methods from your application delegate:
 *
 * - 'didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:withCompletionHandler:'
 * - 'didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:withNotificationHandler:'
 * - 'didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:withNotificationHandler:'
 * - 'didReceiveRemoteNotification:withNotificationHandler:'
 *
 * You can optionally add a delegate to be informed about errors while initalizing the mobile engagement service and to control the display of local notifications to the user.
